# Design and Provision AML Infrastructure
Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning project lifecycle. Machine learning professionals, data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows: Train and deploy models, and manage MLOps.

You can create a model in Azure Machine Learning or use a model built from an open-source platform, such as Pytorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn. MLOps tools help you monitor, retrain, and redeploy models.
Before deployment with Azure resources, development teams should:
1. [Understand the architecture and design concepts of Azure Machine Learning](1-MLOpsArchitectureConcepts.md).

2. [Learn about model management, deployment, lineage and monitoring with Azure Machine Learning](2-ModelManagement.md).

3. [Understand the technology choices available](3-InfrastructureServiceManagement/1-AMLTechChoices.md).

4. [Understand the technology Selection criteria for edge deployment](3-InfrastructureServiceManagement/2-EdgeDeployment.md).

5. [Understand the Enterprise security and governance for Azure Machine Learning](3-InfrastructureServiceManagement/3-EnterpriseSecurity%26Governance.md)

6. [Set up authentication for Azure Machine Learning resources and workflows](3-InfrastructureServiceManagement/4-Authentication.md)

7. [Manage access to an Azure Machine Learning workspace](3-InfrastructureServiceManagement/5-how-to-assign-roles.md)

8. [Understand cost management of the Azure Machine Learning services](3-InfrastructureServiceManagement/6-cost-management.md)
